// What is a hashmap?
// HashMap is a DS which implements an associative array abstract data type,
// a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function
// to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the
// desired value can be found.

// Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but
// most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might
// cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for
// more than one key

// In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost for each lookup is independent
// of the number of elements stores in the table. Many hash table designs also allow
// arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value pairs, at constant average cost
// per operation.

// In many situations, hash tables turn out to be on average more efficient than
// search trees or any other table lookup structure. For this reason, they are
// widely used in many kinds of computer software, particularly for associative
// arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.

// class HashMap {
//   constructor() {
//
//   }
// }
